{"body":"# Mupy\r\n\r\n![Mupy Logo](https://code.grnet.gr/attachments/1452/mupy_logo.png)\r\n\r\n## What is Mupy?\r\nMupy is a Munin Python Parser. It is written in Python and is powered by Django framework.\r\nIts functionality is pretty straightforward. It parses the HTML DOM of a munin site, stores the graphable\r\ndata into a db and provides a friendly user interface for retrieving munin graphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Munin version compatibility\r\nMupy was built on Munin version 1.4.5, though compatibility with the latest version of Munin will be soon available.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation Requirements\r\nMupy's installation and operation depends on the following modules/packages\r\n\r\n* python-django (>=1.2.3)\r\n* python-mysqldb\r\n* python-ldap (if ldap user auth is needed)\r\n* python-beautifulsoup4 (won't work with <4)\r\n* memcached\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Untar the package (or clone via git) to your desired location, copy settings.py.dist, urls.py.dist, apache/django.wsgi.dist to local files ommiting dist and edit settings.py and apache/django.wsgi according to your needs. Pay special attention to:\r\nMUNIN_URL : url that munin welcome page lives, eg. \"http://munin.example.com\"\r\nMUNIN_CGI_PATH : if images are updated frequently (without the need to visit) then set the cgi path here, eg. \"cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph/\"\r\n2. To serve via Apache (static files),\r\ncreate an alias for the static dir in your apache conf and a WSGI script alias eg.  \r\n\r\n`Alias /static       /<installation_location>/mupy/static`\r\n\r\n`WSGIScriptAlias /      /<installation_location>/mupy/apache/django.wsgi`\r\n\r\n3. Run syncdb and create an admin user. Admin users have permissions to all nodegroups/nodes/graphs\r\n4. Run ./manage.py parse_munin to parse the MUNIN_URL and store data into db\r\n5. Restart Apache (or \"touch apache/django.wsgi\") and enjoy\r\n\r\n \r\n","tagline":"MuPy: A Munin Python wrapper","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
